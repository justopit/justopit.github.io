Sometimes it grows quietly, in spurts, in odd rhythms, and in contexts we didn\u2019t fully control. In a world with limited resources and noisy feedback, we are tempted to make snap judgments: 'this video looks slow, it must be weak' \u2014 but this is a cognitive shortcut, not a strategy.\n\nThe harsh truth is that most cold-start recommendation systems are designed to optimize for early performance, not true potential. They rely on strong, immediate feedback \u2014 often through boosting \u2014 to decide whether to promote a video or drop it. But the signals gathered under boosting are flawed: they are biased, inflated, and context-dependent. They reflect system behavior more than user preference. We know this, and yet we rely on these signals, because they are abundant and fast.\n\nOn the other hand, organic signals \u2014 the ones that emerge when content competes naturally \u2014 are far more truthful. They are what users do when no one is watching. But they are also slow, noisy, and sparse. We don\u2019t like them because they don\u2019t tell us what we want to know quickly. We discard them when they seem weak, and in doing so, we often discard the content that needs just a bit more patience.\n\nThis is the signal dilemma in cold-start:  \n> Do we believe the noisy-but-rich signal that comes from intervention?  \nOr the clean-but-sparse signal that emerges without it?\n\nWe propose a different mindset. Instead of forcing a binary decision early \u2014 boost or not, keep or kill \u2014 we treat cold-start as a **sequential information-gathering process**. Each round of boosting is not a judgment, but a probe. Each round of organic exposure is not a verdict, but a test. And the sequence of these signals, taken together, tells a deeper story than any single spike ever could.\n\nIn our method, we let each piece of content go through multiple rounds of boosting and observation. We do not rush to conclusions. After each phase, we ask: did this content show resilience? Did it grow without help? Did it retain attention when we stopped pushing it? If so, we boost again. If not, we walk away.\n\nThis is not about learning a better scoring model. It is about **building a protocol for trust** \u2014 where trust is earned through growth under constraint.\n\nOver time, we learn to spot content that grows naturally. We allocate more of our limited boost to those pieces, because they prove themselves. Not because they screamed the loudest under spotlight, but because they walked steadily under the sun.\n\nThe lesson is simple but hard to implement:  \n> Don\u2019t just measure what happens under control. Observe what happens when you step back.\n\nOnly then can we build systems that find not just what performs, but what endures.\n\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1753020258, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "createdDate": "2025-07-20", "dateLabelColor": "#0969da"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"bug": "#d73a4a", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "invalid": "#e4e669", "question": "#d876e3", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "Blog Title", "faviconUrl": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://justopit.github.io", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
